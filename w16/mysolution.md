# My Water Consumption and Carbon Footprint Contribution

Water consumption through household appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines can significantly impact my carbon footprint. In this solution, I reflect on how often I use these appliances and calculate their contribution based on a simple point system.

---

## Appliance Usage

- **Dishwasher:** I run my dishwasher approximately **5 times per week**.
- **Washing Machine:** I use my washing machine about **4 times per week**.

---

## Calculation of Points

Based on the following criteria:

| Uses per Week | Points Added |
|---------------|---------------|
| More than 9 times | 3 points |
| 4 to 9 times      | 2 points |
| 1 to 3 times      | 1 point |
| No dishwasher     | 0 points |

### My Calculation:

- **Dishwasher (5 times/week):** 2 points  
- **Washing Machine (4 times/week):** 2 points  

---

## Total Points from Appliance Water Use

**Total Points = 2 (Dishwasher) + 2 (Washing Machine) = 4 points**

---

## Reflection

Although **4 points** may not seem excessive, this still represents a measurable contribution to my householdâ€™s environmental impact. This exercise helped me realize how frequent appliance usage affects resource consumption.

To reduce my carbon and water footprint, I plan to:

- Run the dishwasher and washing machine only when fully loaded.
- Use eco or energy-saving modes whenever possible.
- Avoid unnecessary washing cycles.

These small changes can make a significant difference over time.
